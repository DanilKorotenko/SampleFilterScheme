# SampleFilterScheme
This repository provides update and modifications for this sample:

# Original descrition
This I/O Kit driver project demonstrates a simple filter scheme that matches an HFS+ media object with a custom content hint property. This is a null filter scheme which passes all operations through to its provider unchanged. The sample also illustrates how such a media object can be created using the command line disk image tool.
 
 This sample code has been updated to include a project that produces a universal binary. No code changes were required for it to run correctly on the Developer Transition Systems.
